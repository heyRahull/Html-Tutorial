Goal:
Create a simple HTML portfolio page that introduces yourself with a heading, a short bio, skills, and a blog link using everything you've learned so far.

Instructions:

   - Add alt text attribute.

3. Create a Main Heading

4. Add a Subheading

 Eg : Hello! My name is Rahul. I am a passionate frontend developer who loves to create beautiful and functional websites.
 I enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 I also create helpful tutorials on YouTube for beginners.

6. List Your Skills
   - Use a <ul> tag with at least 3 <li> items (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

7. Add a Blog Link
   - Use an <a> tag linking to a blog or dummy site.
   - It should open in a new tab using target="_blank".

8. Add a Horizontal Line
   - Use <hr> to separate sections.

9. Write an "About Me" Section
